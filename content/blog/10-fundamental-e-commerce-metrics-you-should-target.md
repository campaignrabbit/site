## Customer acquisition cost

Customer acquisition deals with the process of bringing in new customers. The affordability factor, however, can be as expensive as 25%-50%.

Finding new subscribers can be tiring enough but once you achieve the results expected, you would want to go for more. 

Subscribers can be brought in through the inclusion of popups, signing of newsletters and much more. It can be elusive but once you know the right strategies, you can master the art of bringing in subscribers.

If your visitors are continuously denying from subscriptions, then your e-commerce store is turning to a blind alley.

To name some, come up with interesting content, aesthetic website outlook and increased email frequency.
