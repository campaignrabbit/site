It has actually been about 5 years since automation in marketing began and is still ruling digital marketing. If you are new to the scene or not quite sure how automated email campaigns can boost your ROI, here’s a quick read for you.

I’m sure you know a lot about email marketing if you already own online business. Though it is one of the first online marketing channels, it still remains to be more effective and evolving. When I said evolving did the word ‘Automated’ or ‘Personalized’ ring a bell? Well, It has actually been about 5 years since automation in marketing began and is still ruling digital marketing. If you are new to the scene or not quite sure how <link-text url="https://www.campaignrabbit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">automated email campaigns</link-text> can boost your ROI, here’s a quick read for you.

## Automated Email Campaigns – What is it?

Basically, in automated email campaigns, emails are automatically sent to a user who satisfies a particular condition or trigger that you set. For example, for every user who subscribes to your newsletter (the condition), an email thanking and welcoming the user for the subscription will be sent automatically.

Automated email campaigns are like one of those top grossing, successfully running movies. And the way it is going seems like it is going to run this way for a long time. Anyway, the following ways are how exactly they grow your online business.
## Nourish Customer relationships

Back when linear communication happened between customers and store owners, they didn’t have the opportunity to have a personal connection with them. The customers cannot give feedback or response. But, since automation in marketing began in 2013, customers had the feeling that they are taken care of personally.

Imagine that you have your customers birth date in your database (which most of them do), when you wish them and send a special promotion for their birthday, doesn’t that sound cool? So there’s not only transactions happening, but also bonding.

You end up gaining customer loyalty. And as a result, it motivates them to buy something from your site when you provide timely and relevant information in the sales cycle. It also gives them a better sense of understanding of their needs which improve the overall perception of your business.
## Lead nurturing

When you look at automation, it is mainly used to set up a <link-text url="https://www.campaignrabbit.com/blog/types-of-ecommerce-emails-to-send/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">series of emails that nurture leads.</link-text> Contacts play a vital role in any business. Agree? Especially in the middle of the sales funnel, automated email marketing contributes a lot to it. Sending guided messages that are triggered by the customer’s on-site behaviour can immensely accelerate conversions.

At the same time, <link-text url="http://www.unspunmarketing.com/lead-nurturing-emails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">lead nurturing</link-text> doesn’t only mean quantity of leads but also the quality. With the help of email marketing, you can know which leads are most likely to convert. High-quality leads are a result of acquiring insight into the behaviours and actions of leads.

## Abandonment recovery

Automated email campaigns enable you to follow up with the people who abandoned carts and failed to make a purchase, thus reducing  <link-text url="https://www.campaignrabbit.com/blog/reduce-cart-abandonment-recovery-solutions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cart abandonment.</link-text> This characteristic of recovery is the beauty of automation. It is like getting back what you lost. Well, if not all of them. This is possible only in non-linear communication.

These follow-up emails have proven to be the main function in converting into sales. This is why it is important to have a database like who is opening emails, who is clicking on links, who is visiting certain landing pages, and who is the downloading content.
## Gain success by Measuring it

Clearly, the biggest advantages of using email marketing are that a gives a report on campaign performance. When you have such track of information on success margins, it paves a way to further planning and implementation. This eventually gets the return on average campaigns several times higher. Success measurement was never this easy earlier.

Even from a consultant’s perspective, metric and data-driven counsel is more effective and acts as a central to their success.
